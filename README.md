Description of the project:

We work for an oil drilling company. We have data of oil wells in three regions. 
The parameters of each oil well in the regions are already known. The goal is to create 
a model that helps to choose the region with the highest profit margin and analyzing potential 
benefits and risks using the bootstrapping technique.


The project is done in VS code with Jupyter Notebook extension.

In this repository you can find the .csv file to perform this analysis
